title: Groovy's Fold

I began making use of `collect` and `findAll` very quickly when I started using Groovy, both had obvious value and replaced tedious Java boilerplate. It wasn’t until I read **Beginning Scala** by *David Pollack* that I began to associate these with functional programming as well as discovering a third awesome function, `fold`. Of the common higher order functions that I have come across and use `fold` isn't one that is nearly as intuitive as `map` (groovy `collect`) or filter (groovy `findAll`).
