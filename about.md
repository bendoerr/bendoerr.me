# Benjamin R. Doerr
As a younger man, but not necessarily "young" by any objective standard, I had a driving phase. For some reason, I felt as though it was vitally important that I drive for hours and hours without apparent purpose. This phase was accompanied by copied cds from such outfits as The Doors, Pink Floyd, and Phish. Indiana has no shortage of prairie roadway, mile upon mile of immaculate surfaces too vast for any kind of enforcement. I saw something on the road as I was driving, at perhaps sixty miles per hour, in the middle of a rainstorm, in the dead of night. It made me who I am today.

I am now a professional software developer. But I really like to think of myself as a Hacker but not in a bad way (if you note my 5th grade autobiography it's what I always wanted to be). Right now I am playing with things named [groovy] and [grails] while tackling complex problems created by politicians during my day job. At night I am a [scala] fanboy. Having tasted the functional programming koolaid and having it knock me off my feet, I see all kinds of new solutions to problems. On the weekends hack in my garden, with the goal of one day turning our [family farm][farm] into a self sustainable business. If you want to hack with me, or have something to tell me feel free to get a hold of me day or night.
