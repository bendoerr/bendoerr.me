    <h3><i class="icon-bullhorn"></i> Learning Haskell</h3>
    <p>I started learning Haskell at the start of Summer '12 since I failed
    miserable to understand Scala earlier. Haskell has been a great adventure
    which I've taken at a leisurely pace.</p>
    <p>Follow along as I learn more about Monads and maybe even Arrows.</p>

    <h3><i class="icon-tasks"></i> Everyday Java</h3>
    <p>Most days I can be found deep in some JVM based code, from Groovy and
    Java, sometimes Scala and maybe one day Closure. I've been crafting on the
    JVM since I began programming.</p>
    <p>I'll share the tips and tricks that I discover everyday.</p>

    <h3><i class="icon-leaf"></i> Gardening</h3>
    <p>My non-technical passion is Gardening. I started keeping a Garden when I
    moved to Virgina after college. If you haven't succeeded with a garden
    before, don't worry nighter have I.</p>
    <p>Watch as I fail, fail some more, and maybe succeed growing something.</p>
